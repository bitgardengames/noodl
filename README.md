# 🧪 Game Polish Checklist

## 🎮 Game Feel
- [x] Add sfx/audio cue for achievements popping

## 🖼️ Visual Polish
- [x] Add screen glow/vignette during high scores or powerups

## 🗂️ Systems Polish
- [ ] Add achievements for edge cases (like collecting a fruit at the same time as dying)
- [x] Add sound/music toggle directly on pause/settings screen
- [ ] Improve save data feedback (e.g. "Saved!" text on exit)
- [x] Ensure achievements persist and can't be earned multiple times erroneously

## 🧠 Accessibility & Settings
- [ ] Allow keyboard rebinding or arrow/WASD toggle

## 🎯 Design & Balance
- [x] Document why fruit value and tail length matter to the game loop
- [x] Prototype fruit streak systems that interact with tail length
- [ ] Evaluate cosmetic unlocks tied to extreme tail milestones

### Combo Updates
- Removed Tail Rhythm tiers so fruit streaks no longer depend on tail length.
- Simplified combo messaging to focus on the current streak without "Tail Flow" bonuses.

## 🏁 Final Touches / Launch Polish
- [x] Add game version to main menu
- [ ] Add credits screen (can be simple)
- [x] Add loading screen for transitions with fade
- [ ] Add splash screen or intro logo
- [ ] Final pass for consistent fonts / text sizes
