# üêç Noodl: Descent of the Coil

## Lore + Upgrade Phase Narrative Framework

### üåë Overview
- The Endless Coil is an ever-shifting labyrinth carved by the Great Serpent Deity.
- Each floor represents a living fragment of the deity's body, forming corridors that pulse with ancient will.
- Consuming fruit pays tribute to the deity; gathering enough awakens the serpent spirit to grant a Blessing of the Coil in the Shrine of Scales interlude.

### üïØÔ∏è The Endless Coil
> "Beneath all worlds lies the Coil ‚Äî a serpent so vast it folds upon itself forever. To descend is to be devoured‚Ä¶ and to become divine."

- The Endless Coil is simultaneously dungeon and deity.
- Each layer explores a distinct region of the serpent's body (stomach, heart, bone, nerve, etc.).
- Floor geometry, hazards, and ambience evolve to reflect the living environment.
- Symbolism reinforces the roguelite loop of rebirth, shedding, and transformation.

### üçé The Fruit Offerings
- Glowing fruit act as offerings of devotion infused with the Coil's life energy.
- Collecting fruit allows the snake to descend deeper and sparks manifestations of the serpent god.
- Mechanically enables:
  - Progression gating by fruit count per floor.
  - Upgrade triggers as fruit function as spiritual currency.
  - Diegetic justification for upgrade phases between floors.

### üèõÔ∏è The Shrine of Scales (Card Phase)
> "The air ripples. The world uncoils. Three Scales tilt in divine balance‚Ä¶"

- Between floors, the snake enters a timeless golden chamber: the Shrine of Scales.
- Three floating Scales of Fate (upgrade cards) appear as avatars of the deity's will.
- The player selects a single Blessing to internalize, manifesting new instincts, mutations, or powers.
- Presentation goals:
  - Palette of deep golds, blacks, and greens with shimmering scale-like textures.
  - Soundscape blending a low hiss with choral undertones.
  - Cards inscribed with serpent sigils, illuminated as though underwater.

### ‚ú® Blessings of the Coil
| Name | Effect | Flavor Text |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Fang of Swiftness** | Move 10% faster. | "The coil strikes before thought itself." |
| **Shed of Renewal** | Heal slightly after each floor. | "To shed one‚Äôs husk is to be reborn in devotion." |
| **Venom‚Äôs Promise** | Attacks inflict poison. | "All that touches the coil must suffer to grow." |
| **Eye of the Deep Coil** | Reveal upcoming hazards earlier. | "The serpent sees beyond its skin." |
| **Whispering Skin** | Reduce damage from hazards slightly. | "The scales hum with divine resistance." |
| **Hollow Maw** | Fruit grants more energy. | "Hunger is worship." |
| **Ouroboric Will** | On death, resurrect once with half health. | "The end and the beginning share a single tooth." |

### üï≥Ô∏è Descent to the Next Floor
- After choosing a Blessing, the Shrine collapses inward and the snake spirals through a tunnel lined with glowing scales.
- The deity acknowledges the offering: "The Coil accepts your devotion. The next depth awaits."
- The next arena loads with increased intensity‚Äîfaster, denser, darker, or more hazardous.
- Each descent emphasizes moving deeper into the serpent's body.

### üìú Optional Mythos Expansion
- Introduce collectible lore fragments (scrolls, fruit descriptions, floor intros) to gradually reveal serpent mythology.
- Sample fragments:
  - "Before the first fruit ripened, the Serpent coiled around chaos itself. Each shedding birthed a world."
  - "Every follower must feed the Coil ‚Äî for only through hunger does it dream."
- Benefits:
  - Adds replay-value lore hunts.
  - Infuses the roguelite loop with spiritual resonance.
  - Sets up an endgame reveal: the player-controlled snake is a shard of the deity seeking reunion.
