# Visual Takeaways from *ROUNDS*

This note distills visual presentation ideas from the lessons document to guide potential updates to Noodl's look and feel.

## Arena & Combat Presentation
- **One-screen, compact arenas.** Keep critical combat space fully visible to support readability in hectic moments and reduce camera friction.
- **Destructible cover with visible states.** Highlight damage states through crumbling sprites or palette shifts so the battlefield feels alive and responsive.
- **Readable physics exaggeration.** Amplify jump arcs, knockback trails, and projectile effects with bold silhouettes and motion streaks to clarify combat flow.
- **Diegetic hit feedback.** Favor screen shake, color flashes, and knockback cues over UI overlays to communicate impact without clutter.

## Upgrade Draft Experience
- **Celebratory card reveal.** When presenting upgrades, dim the background, zoom toward the selection, and animate card entrances to emphasize the moment.
- **Card motif across UI.** Reuse card-shaped panels and rounded frames in menus, victory screens, and tooltips to reinforce the upgrade identity.
- **Tooltip clarity by rarity.** Surface concise stats upfront while reserving detailed behavior notes for hover or rarer items to keep choices snappy.
- **Synergy tags and highlights.** Add small badge graphics (e.g., "Bounce", "Explosive") on upgrade cards to visually hint at combos without verbose text.

## Visual Identity
- **Bold, flat color palettes.** Employ high-contrast color blocking with thick outlines on characters and UI to maintain readability and support rapid skinning.
- **Dynamic backgrounds.** Layer simple gradient backdrops with subtle animated elements (particles, parallax shapes) to keep minimalist scenes energetic.
- **Consistent typography.** Pair the flat aesthetic with clean, geometric fonts on cards and menus for cohesion.

## Feedback & Audio Integration
- **Chunky SFX visualization.** Tie distinct sound cues to matching visual bursts (e.g., waveform flashes, vibration trails) so players associate mechanics quickly.
- **Rhythmic UI pulses.** Sync ambient beats with gentle UI pulses or particle bursts to enhance tempo without overwhelming gameplay focus.

Implementing these ideas can help Noodl capture the readable chaos and celebratory moments that give *ROUNDS* its visual appeal while maintaining the game's unique identity.
