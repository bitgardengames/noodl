Comprehensive upgrade reference reflecting current scripted behavior for balance and value audits.

| Name | Rarity | Effect Summary | Tags | Stacking | Scaling & Timing | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Extra Bite | Common | Lowers the next exit's fruit requirement by 1 while increasing rock spawn chance by 15%. | Hazard | No | Applies immediately and persists for the entire run. | In-game tag: Hazard. Fruit goal reduction stacks with other sources; rock penalty compounds with spawn multipliers. |
| Fresh Supplies | Common | Discards every offered shop card and restocks all slots with new options. | Economy | Yes (duplicates allowed) | Each copy is a single-use reroll that resolves instantly when purchased. | Weight 0.6 in the shop pool; no effect outside shops. |
| Serpent’s Reflex | Common | Increases movement speed by 4% per copy. | Mobility | Yes | Speed multipliers stack multiplicatively each time you buy it. | Localization of `serpents_reflex`. Excellent early mobility filler and feeds into speed breakpoints. |
| Stone Whisperer | Common | Multiplies the global rock spawn rate by 0.6 (40% fewer rocks). | Hazard, Rocks | No | Passive modifier that applies to all future floor contexts. | In-game tag: Hazard, Rocks. Stacks multiplicatively with other rock spawn effects. |
| Stone Census | Common | Each Economy-tag upgrade you own reduces rock spawn chance by 7%, to a 20% floor. | Economy, Defense | No | Recalculates whenever you gain an Economy-tag upgrade and keeps reductions across floors. | Requires the Economy tag to appear. Combines with shop slot scaling (Guild Ledger, Radiant Charter). |
| Stone Skin | Uncommon | Grants a Stone Skin shield that blocks one hazard, shatters rocks on impact, and adds saw grace. | Defense | Yes (max 4 stacks) | Awards +1 shield per stack; rock-triggered breaks also destroy the nearest rock. | In-game tag: Defense. Saw grace stacks add survivability versus saw lanes. |
| Shield Recycler | Uncommon | After three shield charges break, immediately forges a fresh shield. | Defense | No | Tracks shield breaks across the run; progress persists between floors. | In-game tag: Defense. Works with any shield source, including Stone Skin and Contract of Cinders. |
| Adrenaline Surge | Uncommon | After each fruit, grants a 3 s adrenaline burst at 1.5× speed. | Adrenaline | No | Triggers on every fruit collected once owned. | In-game tag: Adrenaline. Enables momentum packages and fuels Molting Reflex. |
| Tempest Ward | Uncommon | Collecting 20 fruit forges a bonus shield once. | Defense | No | Progress carries across floors until the threshold is reached, then the upgrade is spent. | Localization of `pocket_springs`. No further effect after the shield is awarded. |
| Mapmaker's Compass | Uncommon | At each floor start, reduces the most common hazard spawn by 1; if none can be reduced, awards 2 score and stalls saws for 0.6 s. | Defense, Utility | No (rarely stacks) | Re-evaluates every floor start; additional stacks (from non-shop sources) increase the reduction by +1 per two extra stacks. | In-game tags: Defense, Utility. Keeps track of the chosen hazard and re-applies if floor context changes. |
| Molting Reflex | Uncommon | When a shield absorbs a hit, triggers an adrenaline surge lasting 60% of the base duration. | Adrenaline, Defense | No | Requires the adrenaline system (e.g., Adrenaline Surge) to be active; fires on every shield consumption. | In-game tags: Adrenaline, Defense. Only offered once you have an Adrenaline-tag upgrade. |
| Mystery Card | Rare | Reveals and grants a random upgrade from the current shop pool when purchased. | Utility, Risk, Shop | Yes | Awarded upgrade applies instantly and persists for the run. | Hidden description until selection; duplicates roll independent random upgrades. |
| Sawblade Sinkhole | Uncommon | After each fruit, all saws sink beneath their tracks for 1.6 s. | Defense | No | Duration stacks additively with other saw-sink bonuses on the run. | In-game tag: Defense. Creates a consistent breathing window against saw spam. |
| Resonant Shell | Uncommon | For the first five Defense-tag upgrades you own, reduces saw travel speed by 8% (to a 55% floor) and adds +0.08 s laser charge time per upgrade. | Defense | No | Recomputes whenever you gain a Defense-tag upgrade; only the first five count. | Requires the Defense tag to appear. Great in shield-heavy builds, now focusing on slowing saw lanes instead of extending stalls. |
| Verdant Bonds | Uncommon | Economy upgrades grant Verdant Growth equal to stacks; every 3 growth forges a shield. | Economy, Defense | Yes (max 3 stacks) | Progress persists between purchases and floors; caps at 9 stored growth to prevent overflows. | In-game tags: Economy, Defense. Incentivizes shop-heavy economy lines. |
| Guild Ledger | Uncommon | Each shop slot reduces rock spawn chance by 3%. | Economy, Defense | No | Updates automatically whenever your shop slot count changes. | Requires the Economy tag. Combines well with slot boosters such as Golden Debt and Caravan Contract. |
| Radiant Charter | Uncommon | Each shop slot removes 1 laser (min 0) and adds 1 saw to floor generation. | Economy, Defense | No | Recalculates on any change to total shop slots. | Requires the Economy tag. Lets you trade laser pressure for saw density that you can counter-build around. |
| Sparkstep Relay | Uncommon | Whenever you dash, shatters the nearest rock and stalls saws for 0.6 s. | Mobility, Defense | No | Triggers on every dash activation. | Requires the Mobility tag to appear. Pairs best with Thunder Dash or other dash sources. |
| Quick Fangs | Rare | Increases movement speed by 10% per stack, up to four stacks. | Mobility | Yes (max 4 stacks) | Applies multiplicatively with other speed effects and records stack count for visuals. | Dramatic speed spike—ensure hazard control to stay safe. |

| Tremor Bloom | Rare | Each fruit sends a shockwave that pushes nearby hazards one tile outward. | Mobility, Hazard, Rocks, Control | No | Activates on every fruit collected. | Excellent for carving lanes through dense arenas and supplementing rock clearing. |
| Volatile Bloom | Legendary | After each fruit, drop a timed charge on the tile you just left. After a brief fuse it explodes in a small radius, destroying rocks and saws while granting shield and combo progress for every hazard caught. | Hazard, Rocks, Defense | No | Blast radius is roughly one tile; explosions count as rock breaks for Stone Skin and Tremor Bloom synergies. |
| Golden Debt | Rare | Adds +1 shop slot, but every upgrade purchase permanently raises the next exit's fruit goal by 1. | Economy, Risk, Shop, Progression | No | Fruit tax stacks run-wide and updates the UI immediately. | In-game tags: Economy, Risk, Shop, Progression. Works with rerolls and free pickups. |
| Caravan Contract | Uncommon | Grants +1 shop card per stack with no drawbacks. | Economy, Risk | Yes | Effects persist for the run and scale linearly with stacks. | In-game tags: Economy, Risk. Pure shop depth—combo with Guild Ledger/Radiant Charter for hazard tuning. |
| Gilded Obsession | Rare | Shops always include a guaranteed Rare slot; buying a Rare queues a random extra laser or saw for the next floor. | Economy, Risk, Hazard | No | Pending hazards are stored until the following floor spawns, then cleared. | In-game tags: Economy, Risk, Hazard. Track floor previews to plan around injected hazards. |
| Glutton's Wake | Rare | Fruit grant double score but crystallize into rocks after leaving your tail. | Economy, Risk, Hazard, Rocks | No | Applies to every fruit collected after purchase. | In-game tags: Economy, Risk, Rocks, Hazard. Demands careful routing or supplemental rock control. |

| Thunder Dash | Rare | Unlocks a dash: 0.35 s at 2.4× speed on a 6 s cooldown that breaks rocks on contact. | Mobility | No | Shares cooldown with other dash-triggered effects. | Unlock requirement: Abilities tag. Foundation for Sparkstep Relay loops. |
| Chrono Ward | Rare | Whenever a shield is consumed, slows time to roughly 45% speed for ~0.85 s. | Defense, Utility | No | Uses the run's chrono ward settings on every shield break. | Unlock requirement: Timekeeper. Buy with reliable shield income for consistent slow-motion windows. |

| Deliberate Coil | Epic | Reduces movement speed by 15% (0.85×) and increases the exit fruit requirement by 1. | Speed, Risk | No | Effects are permanent once taken. | Unlock requirement: Speedcraft. Self-imposed challenge for players wanting more planning time. |
| Abyssal Catalyst | Epic | Instantly grants 1 shield, boosts combo rewards by 20%, and makes lasers 15% faster to charge, 10% faster to fire, with 0.5 s shorter cooldowns. | Defense, Risk | No | Laser modifiers and combo bonus persist for the run; shield is granted on purchase. | Unlock requirement: Abyssal Protocols. High reward but meaningfully tougher laser timings. |
| Spectral Harvest | Epic | Once per floor, an echo instantly collects the fruit that follows your next pickup. | Economy, Combo | No | Resets at each floor start; triggers on the next fruit after you collect one. | Provides burst fruit intake for combo chains and fast exits. |

| Contract of Cinders | Epic | Gain 2 shields immediately; every shield break plants an ember that spawns a saw on the next floor. | Defense, Risk, Hazard | No | Pending ember saws accumulate through the floor and deploy when the next floor generates. | In-game tag: Defense. High frontline safety traded for future hazard load. |
| Phoenix Echo | Epic | Stores a charge that rewinds a fatal crash without resetting the floor. | Defense, Risk | No | Charges persist between floors and are consumed on use; additional sources add more charges. | Unlock requirement: Abyssal Protocols. Excellent insurance for risky endgame pushes. |
