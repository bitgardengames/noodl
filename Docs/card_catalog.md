# Card Catalog

| Name | Rarity | Description | Tags | Stackable | Scaling Behavior | Notable details |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Amber Bloom | Common | Track shattered rocks; every third one forges 25% shield progress, letting environmental cleanup snowball into extra protection. | Defense, Rocks, Hazard Control | No | Repeatable trigger tied to rock destruction. | Visual: Shield progress burst when shattered rocks add protection. Helps sustain shields on rock-heavy floors. |
