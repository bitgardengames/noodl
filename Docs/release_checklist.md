# Release Checklist

1. **Polish the floor feel/progression/look**
   - Ensure each floor has a distinct visual identity and gameplay feel.
   - Verify hazard colors are vibrant and readable during play.
   - Capture test screenshots for every floor to confirm they present well in marketing materials.

2. **Polish the menus**
   - Review every menu screen to confirm consistent typography, spacing, padding, and alignment.
   - Validate that all critical information is surfaced clearly and flows logically for the player.
   - Perform usability spot-checks to make sure navigation and interactions feel responsive and polished.

3. **Sound pass**
   - Audit all sound effects and music tracks, replacing or removing any weak assets and filling missing moments.
   - Balance audio levels to keep a cohesive sonic mix across gameplay, UI, and ambient tracks.
   - If budget allows, contract bespoke audio tracks with full rights for release, ensuring they embody a unique “Noodl” tone and can be shared on official channels.
