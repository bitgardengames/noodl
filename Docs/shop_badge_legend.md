# Shop Upgrade Badge Legend

Shop upgrade cards surface a small badge next to the title so players can read an upgrade's role at a glance. Each badge is keyed off the upgrade's tag list: the shop looks up the first matching tag in its badge dictionary and renders the associated shape and color, falling back to a default pill when no specific match exists.

*Badge shapes are rendered by dedicated drawing helpers that map abstract names like `triangle_up` or `capsule` to Love2D primitives, ensuring consistent silhouettes and rounding across the interface.*

### Notes

* All badge colors pull from the active theme when possible, falling back to the RGBA tints listed above whenever a theme omits a swatch.
* Upgrades that declare multiple tags use the first tag with a registered badge; if none of the tags are recognized, the default circle badge is used.
