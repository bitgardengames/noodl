# Run-to-Run Variety and Retention Ideas

This document captures potential levers for increasing tension, moment-to-moment fun, and long-term engagement without discarding the current floor-by-floor hazard ramp.

## Layered Encounter Modifiers
- **Rotating mutators:** Inject temporary rules like double-speed conveyors or mirrored controls for a single floor to create surprise spikes layered atop the baseline hazard plan.
- **Branching encounters:** Offer optional doors or portal nodes that swap in variant hazard packs, letting players trade safety for rewards and refreshing decision points each session.

## Fruit and Combo System Extensions
- **Escalating combo tiers:** Unlock new benefits—extra score multipliers, shield pulses, or hazard slowdowns—when players maintain streaks longer than existing thresholds.
- **Time-limited fruit buffs:** Let select fruit types grant short-lived effects (e.g., magnetic pickups, dash charges) to amplify tension between aggressive play and risk management.
- **High-stakes fruit variants:** Introduce rare fruit that promises large payouts but spawns near dangerous saw clusters or requires carrying through a gauntlet before it matures.

## Mid-Run Goals and Meta Progression
- **Dynamic objectives:** Surface rotating mini-challenges (avoid conveyor hits for two floors, rescue trapped fruit) that tap into the achievement framework for on-the-run rewards.
- **Milestone-based unlocks:** Tie new cosmetics or upgrade rarities to cumulative feats—such as total perfect floors or combo streak lengths—to encourage repeated runs.
- **Synergy scouting:** Track recently unlocked upgrades and suggest loadout pairings during downtime screens to keep players chasing fresh build experiments.
