# Run-to-Run Variety and Retention Ideas

This document captures potential levers for increasing tension, moment-to-moment fun, and long-term engagement without discarding the current floor-by-floor hazard ramp.

## Layered Encounter Modifiers
- **Rotating mutators:** Inject temporary rules like double-speed conveyors or mirrored controls for a single floor to create surprise spikes layered atop the baseline hazard plan.
- **Branching encounters:** Offer optional doors or portal nodes that swap in variant hazard packs, letting players trade safety for rewards and refreshing decision points each session.

## Fruit and Combo System Extensions
- **Escalating combo tiers:** Unlock new benefits—extra score multipliers, shield pulses, or hazard slowdowns—when players maintain streaks longer than existing thresholds.
- **Time-limited fruit buffs:** Let select fruit types grant short-lived effects (e.g., magnetic pickups, dash charges) to amplify tension between aggressive play and risk management.
- **High-stakes fruit variants:** Introduce rare fruit that promises large payouts but spawns near dangerous saw clusters or requires carrying through a gauntlet before it matures.

## Mid-Run Goals and Meta Progression
- **Dynamic objectives:** Surface rotating mini-challenges (avoid conveyor hits for two floors, rescue trapped fruit) that tap into the achievement framework for on-the-run rewards.
- **Milestone-based unlocks:** Tie new cosmetics or upgrade rarities to cumulative feats—such as total perfect floors or combo streak lengths—to encourage repeated runs.
- **Synergy scouting:** Track recently unlocked upgrades and suggest loadout pairings during downtime screens to keep players chasing fresh build experiments.

## ROUNDS-Inspired Enhancements
- **Shorter, punchier encounter sets:** Experiment with mini-gauntlets that chain two or three micro-floors together before a breather screen. Borrowing *ROUNDS*' sub-minute cadence can keep the session lively while respecting the existing floor-based structure.
- **Comeback-biased upgrade drafts:** When players fall behind on objectives or take multiple deaths in a row, surface a weighted pick list of power-ups the way *ROUNDS* hands the next card to the underdog. This maintains tension and encourages riskier play without erasing skill differentials.
- **Themed synergy tags:** Introduce simple tags on upgrades ("Bounce", "Dash", "Shield") inside the UI to hint at combo potential, mirroring how *ROUNDS* celebrates loose archetypes. Tags can drive contextual tooltips that highlight related picks the player already owns.
- **Celebratory pick moments:** When offering mid-run choices—fruit mutators, achievement rewards, or shop bundles—temporarily dim the arena, zoom the camera, and present oversized cards or panels. Leaning into *ROUNDS*' theatrical draft treatment reinforces that these decisions define the run.
- **Expressive yet readable hit feedback:** Layer screen shakes, outline pulses, and knockback exaggeration onto existing hazard collisions to ensure important events land with the same clarity *ROUNDS* achieves through diegetic effects. Keep the motion brief so precision platforming remains fair.
- **Compact, destructible arena variants:** Prototype bite-sized rooms that can crumble or reconfigure after repeated hazard triggers, creating evolving layouts reminiscent of *ROUNDS*' destructible cover while still serving our fruit-chasing loop.
- **Loop-friendly restart flow:** Streamline post-run menus with a single "Rematch" or "Retry floor" action that skips deep menu nesting, acknowledging the party-game pacing that keeps *ROUNDS* sticky during couch sessions.
