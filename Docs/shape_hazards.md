# Shape-Driven Hazard Concepts

This note explores how to extend the existing saw blade motif—constructed from triangles, circles, and rectangles—into a broader library of hazards, traps, and environmental set-pieces while staying inside the "basic shapes + 3 px outline" visual language.

## Design Principles

1. **Silhouette First** – Combine primitives to create easily readable outlines at gameplay scale.
2. **Layered Depth** – Use offsets, scaling, and concentric shapes to fake lighting and depth.
3. **Motion Implies Detail** – Let animation do the heavy lifting instead of intricate art.
4. **Palette Tokens** – Re-use existing light/shadow/edge colors to keep everything cohesive.
